## Salesforce Terminology

# Campaign

A campaign is an outbound marketing project that you want to plan, manage, and track within Salesforce. It can be a direct mail program, seminar, print advertisement, email, or other type of marketing initiative.

- Bulleted Accounts
Accounts are your organization’s customers, competitors, and partners. Each account stores information such as name, address, and phone numbers. For each account, you can store related information such as opportunities, activities, cases, partners, contracts, and notes.


### Contacts
Contacts are all of the individuals associated with your business accounts that you need to track in Salesforce. You can store various information for a contact, such as phone numbers, addresses, titles, and roles in a deal.

1. Opportunities
Opportunities are the sales and pending deals that you want to track. By adding opportunities, you are also building your “pipeline,” which will contribute to your forecast. You can also link opportunities to campaigns to help measure the ROI of your marketing programs.

Leads
A lead is a prospect or potential opportunity – a person you met at a conference who expressed interest, or someone who filled out a form on your company’s website.

Products
Products are the individual items that you sell on your opportunities. You can create a product and associate it with a price in a price book. Each product can exist in many different price books with many different prices. A product that is listed in a price book with an associated price is called a price book entry.

Contracts
A contract is a written agreement between two or more parties. Many companies use contracts to define the terms for doing business with other companies. Track the contract through your organization’s approval process and use workflow alerts to notify yourself when to initiate contract renewal.

Task
Tasks are to-do items that need to be followed up on. They can be associated with accounts, contacts, leads, or other custom objects. You can follow up on the task yourself, or assign it to another user.

Activities
Maintain a historical record of all activities related to an account, contact, or opportunity. Your activity history includes emails, call notes, and calendar events, so everyone is on the same page.

Reports
Reports are lists, summaries, and analyses of your data, which you can display or print. To help you monitor your organization, Salesforce offers a wide range of standard reports, accessible in the Reports tab. You can also create new custom reports to access exactly the information you need. You can subtotal and limit your data to help you analyze trends and get a concise picture of what is happening in your organization.

Dashboards
Dashboards give you a real-time snapshot of corporate metrics and key performance indicators. A dashboard is a group of different charts (or components) that graphically display your custom report data. You can select up to 20 different custom reports to display data graphically as  charts in each dashboard.

Email Templates
With Salesforce you can create email templates for common emails such as web-to-lead responses, sales prospecting, announcements, and internal workflow. You can even personalize parts of the email with information from the contact or account record.

Import Wizard
The ability to easily import data into Salesforce is one of the application’s key benefits. Import excel worksheets or CSV (comma separated value) files. Map the information to leads, contacts, accounts, solutions, and custom objects. Search Import Tools on Successforce.com for more information.
